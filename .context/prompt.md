# FastAPI Production Standard Template

This folder contains a production-grade FastAPI backend template with standardized structure, modularity, and best practices. It is designed to provide a solid foundation for building robust, maintainable API services that can scale in production environments.

## Core Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with a well-defined directory structure
- **Scalability**: Support for API versioning and multiple data sources
- **Reliability**: Built-in resilience patterns using Stamina for retry logic and circuit breakers
- **Observability**: Prometheus monitoring for API, database, and external service metrics
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing, and role-based access control
- **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns for repositories, services, and API endpoints
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Environment-specific configurations for local, dev, and production

## Key Features

1. **API Versioning**: Structured support for multiple API versions to maintain backward compatibility
2. **Multiple Data Sources**: Architecture supports connecting to multiple databases or external APIs
3. **Resilience Patterns**: Retry logic and circuit breakers to handle transient failures
4. **Prometheus Monitoring**: Separate metrics server for production-grade monitoring
5. **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer that abstracts database operations
6. **Modern Dependency Management**: Using UV with pyproject.toml for faster, more reliable dependencies

## Getting Started

To use this template:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create environment-specific configuration files
2. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to start the application in different environments
3. Add your own models, repositories, services, and API endpoints following the established patterns

## Recommended Extensions

Depending on your specific needs, consider extending the template with:

1. Background task processing using Celery or similar
2. WebSocket support for real-time applications
3. Caching layer using Redis
4. API documentation extensions
5. Comprehensive test suites
